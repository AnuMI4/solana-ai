I want to develop a Solana program using Anchor framework, test cases using typescript and a typescript SDK to interact with the program.
--- File structure for the Anchor program ---
Please structure the project into multiple files for ease of management.
Account-related code should be in state.rs
Each instruction should be in its own file, grouped by groups of users.
The function inside the file should be run_[the name of the file]
Remember to add mod.rs in the folder and sub-folders in the instructions.
The mod.rs file should include 'pub use [filename]::*;' at the beginning of the file.
--- Library ---
Use @coral-xyz/anchor for typescript test code
Use Anchor version >= 0.30.0
--- The test ---
Write test cases using typescript for each of the functions. The test-case should use the SDK.
--- The ts SDK ---
The SDK should cover all instructions and function to get all accounts with filters.
--- The app ---
  This is a Hello Solana App for .
There are 1 accounts in this program.
Greeting is ; with data structure as authority: Pubkey greeting_count: u64; the seed is [publicKey]
There are 2 instructions in this program.
initialize is a instruction, This function let user initialize a greeting with parameters:authority: Pubkey; and logic as following: 
increment_greeting is a instruction, This function let user increment the greeting count with parameters:; and logic as following: increment the greeting counter by 1
